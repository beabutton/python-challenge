EDIT: My internet went down I have a tech coming tomorrow at 8am my assignment is NOT done as of 7:30pm 7/19/23 however I want to upload something to ensure I am ontime with at least half. I will reupload when my connection is repaired. I am trying to avoid point loss. 

For the budget analysis I utalized quite a few resources when AskBCS was unresponsive. I compared a few different solutions to build backwards something the worked nicely. I ran into a few issues with my txt file but was able to resolve them with the help of a few forum searches and trial and error.
